            <p>M&M's Milk Chocolate are small, color-coated chocolate candies that are popular worldwide. They are produced by Mars, Incorporated and have been a beloved treat since their introduction in 1941. The iconic candy features a colorful candy shell that encases a smooth milk chocolate. <br>
                M&M's are known for their distinctive "m" logo imprinted on each candy shell, which stands for the initials of Forrest Mars and Bruce Murrie, the founders of the original M&M's company. The candy is available in a variety of colors, and each color typically corresponds to a specific flavor, although the milk chocolate variant is the classic and most widely recognized.
                <br>
                The candy shell provides a satisfying crunch when bitten into, contrasting with the creamy and rich milk chocolate at the core. M&M's Milk Chocolate come in various packaging sizes, from small, shareable bags to larger, resealable pouches and containers. They are often enjoyed as a snack, used in baking, or incorporated into desserts, making them a versatile and enduringly popular treat for people of all ages.
